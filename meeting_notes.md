**Paper** :

**Questions**

1) What were the main questions the authors were investigating?
2) What approaches did they use to test those questions?
3) What were their results?
4) How the authors interpret their conclusions in the context of the literature (i.e., what did they say in the discussion)?
5) Did the authors proposed any follow-up questions (generally found in the discussion)?
6) Based on their results, did you have any outstanding questions?

**Agenda**

* Parasite paper discussion
* Reproducibility Review Progress
* RNA-seq tutorial on Discovery cluster
    *issue with "Once fastq_dump has been completed..." task

### Paper Discussion

**Paper** : Proestou2020_GlobalTranscriptomeResponseOysterInfection.pdf

**Questions**

1) What were the main questions the authors were investigating?
    *Investigating difference in transcript expression between resistant vs. susceptible populations of eastern oysters when exposed to P. marinus infection.
    
2) What approaches did they use to test those questions?
    *multiple testing times 
    *rna-seq -> D.E. analysis -> enrichment analysis (?)
    *Sec. 2.3 what is a batch effect?
    
3) What were their results?
    *Sec. 3.2 what is a Q score?
    *Sec. 3.4. what are GO terms?
    
4) How the authors interpret their conclusions in the context of the literature (i.e., what did they say in the discussion)?
    * Control
        *upregulated proteolysis and redox processes (part of immune system)
        *upregulated protease inhibitors @ 36-hrs = inc. importance in early immune response
    *Infected 
        *upregulated GCPR (immune response) and downregulated microtubule (no idea why)
        *'weak, poorly-coordinated transcriptomic response'
    *Not a lot of DE genes
    *CONTRADICTED previous work which suggested a decrease/non-deviation from ROS activity.
    
5) Did the authors proposed any follow-up questions (generally found in the discussion)?
    *"it is unclear why parasite invtervetion would result in the dramatic downregulation of cytoskeletic transcripts"
    
6) Based on their results, did you have any outstanding questions?
